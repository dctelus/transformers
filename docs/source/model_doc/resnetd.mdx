# resnetd

## Overview

The resnetd model was proposed in [Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187) by Tong He, Zhi Zhang, Hang Zhang, Zhongyue Zhang, Junyuan Xie, Mu Li.

ResNetD is a modification on the ResNet architecture. It utilises an embedding layer (stem) composed by three `3x3` convolution layers  and an average pooling in the shortcut to downsample the input.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Much of the recent progress made in image classification research can be credited to training procedure refinements, such as changes in data augmentations and optimization methods. In the literature, however, most refinements are either briefly mentioned as implementation details or only visible in source code. In this paper, we will examine a collection of such refinements and empirically evaluate their impact on the final model accuracy through ablation study. We will show that, by combining these refinements together, we are able to improve various CNN models significantly. For example, we raise ResNet-50's top-1 validation accuracy from 75.3% to 79.29% on ImageNet. We will also demonstrate that improvement on image classification accuracy leads to better transfer learning performance in other application domains such as object detection and semantic segmentation.*

Tips:

- One can use [`AutoFeatureExtractor`] to prepare images for the model.
